GitHub username coolcam380
The repository I created I've cloned and put it in my local computer files.
This GitHub account will be mostly used for cloning or editing files on my computer and future assignments.
The steps it took for me to clone this repository on my local files was that I created a GitHub account, created this repository, gave the URl for it a name then went GitHub desktop, cloned it, and saved it on my computer local files.
